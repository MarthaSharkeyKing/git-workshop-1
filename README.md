# git-workshop-1


There once was a girl called claire

At her screen all she did was stare

Because this git makes no sense

And it makes us really tense

There once was a guy name julian lewins

This day sending him to ruins

He wished it was easier

And that outside was less breezier

So he can bask in the sun
